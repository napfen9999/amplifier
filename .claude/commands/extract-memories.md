# Claude Command: Extract Memories

## Primary Purpose

Provide users with control over memory extraction from unprocessed transcripts. This command offers the choice to extract learnings, ensuring valuable insights aren't lost.

**Note**: After extraction completes, use the built-in `/exit` command to close Claude Code.

## Core Behavior

When the user runs `/extract-memories`, the command:

1. **Checks for unprocessed transcripts** in `.data/transcripts/`
2. **Prompts user**: "Extract memories now? (Y/n)"
3. **If Yes**: Runs synchronous extraction with visible progress
4. **If No**: Skips extraction (transcripts remain queued)
5. **Shows summary** of memories extracted (if extraction ran)
6. **Reminds user**: Use `/exit` to close Claude Code

## Understanding User Intent

This command is typically used when:
- User wants to capture learnings from current session
- User prefers manual control over automatic background processing
- User wants to ensure memories are extracted before ending session

## Implementation Approach

### Step 1: Check for Unprocessed Transcripts

Use the transcript tracking system to identify transcripts that haven't been processed for memory extraction:

```bash
python -c "
from amplifier.memory.transcript_tracker import load_transcripts
transcripts = load_transcripts()
unprocessed = [t for t in transcripts if not t.get('processed', False)]
print(len(unprocessed))
"
```

If zero unprocessed transcripts → Skip extraction prompt, exit immediately

### Step 2: Prompt User

If unprocessed transcripts exist, present clear choice:

```
📝 Found N unprocessed transcript(s)

Extract memories before exit? (Y/n):
```

**Important**: This is the user's decision point. Respect their choice.

### Step 3A: If User Chooses "Yes" - Run Extraction

Execute the extraction worker via watchdog manager:

```bash
python -m amplifier.memory.watchdog
```

**What happens next**:
- Watchdog spawns extraction worker subprocess
- Worker processes unprocessed transcripts sequentially
- Progress updates stream to terminal in real-time
- User sees exactly what's happening (no hidden background work)

**Progress Display** (handled by watchdog):
```
📝 Memory Extraction

Transcripts: [████████░░] 2/3
Current: Processing transcript def456...

[TRIAGE]     Identifying important ranges... ✓
             Found 3 ranges (28% coverage)

[EXTRACTION] Processing 156 messages...
             [████████████████████████████░░] 85%

[STORAGE]    Saving memories... ✓
             Extracted 12 memories
```

**User Control**:
- Press Ctrl+C anytime to cancel → Graceful stop, progress preserved
- Extraction state tracked → Can resume later with `/cleanup`

### Step 3B: If User Chooses "No" - Exit Immediately

Simply exit without extraction. Transcripts remain in queue for future processing.

### Step 4: Show Completion Summary

After extraction completes (if run):

```
✅ Memory Extraction Complete

Processed:  3 transcripts
Extracted:  42 memories
Duration:   2m 15s
Location:   .data/memories/

Memories are now available in future sessions.
```

### Step 5: Remind User How to Close Session

**CRITICAL**: Always end with this message:

```
✅ Memory extraction complete.

To close Claude Code:
- Use the built-in `/exit` command
- Or press Cmd/Ctrl+W
```

This reminds the user that memory extraction is separate from closing Claude Code.

After extraction completes (if run):

```
✅ Memory Extraction Complete

Processed:  3 transcripts
Extracted:  42 memories
Duration:   2m 15s
Location:   .data/memories/

Memories are now available in future sessions.
```

## Error Handling

### Missing API Key

If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` not configured:

```
⚠️  Memory System Not Configured

The memory system requires an Anthropic API key.

To enable:
1. Get API key from console.anthropic.com
2. Add to .env:
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
3. Set MEMORY_SYSTEM_ENABLED=true

For now, exiting without extraction.
```

### Extraction Errors

If extraction fails (API timeout, etc.):

```
❌ Extraction Failed

Error: API timeout after 3 retries

Partial progress saved. Run `/cleanup` to:
- Resume extraction
- View error logs
- Clear state

Logs: .data/memories/logs/extraction_TIMESTAMP.log
```

## Critical Implementation Details

### ⚠️ Subprocess Management

The watchdog pattern is critical:
- **Main process**: Claude Code (this command)
- **Child process**: Watchdog manager
- **Grandchild process**: Extraction worker

**Why**: Isolation. If worker crashes, main process unaffected. State preserved for recovery.

### ⚠️ Progress Streaming

The worker outputs progress via JSON-lines protocol:

```json
{"type": "start", "total_transcripts": 3}
{"type": "progress", "current": 1, "session_id": "abc123", "stage": "triage"}
{"type": "triage_complete", "ranges": 3, "coverage": 0.28}
...
```

The watchdog consumes these and renders the terminal UI. **Don't try to parse this in the command** - just let the subprocess handle it.

### ⚠️ State Tracking

Extraction state saved to `.data/memories/.extraction_state.json`:

```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "started_at": "2025-11-12T15:30:00",
  "pid": 12345,
  "transcripts": [
    {"id": "abc123", "status": "completed", "memories": 8},
    {"id": "def456", "status": "in_progress"},
    {"id": "ghi789", "status": "pending"}
  ]
}
```

**Purpose**: Crash recovery. If extraction interrupted, `/cleanup` can resume from last completed transcript.

## Configuration Requirements

Memory extraction requires:

```bash
# .env file
MEMORY_SYSTEM_ENABLED=true
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...  # From console.anthropic.com
```

Without these, extraction gracefully skips with helpful error message.

## Response Guidelines

### Be Clear About Progress

✅ **Good**: "Extracting memories from 3 transcripts... (2/3 complete)"
❌ **Bad**: "Processing..." (no context)

### Respect User Choice

✅ **Good**: Present option, accept decision
❌ **Bad**: Push user toward extraction or add friction to "No"

### Show Value After Completion

✅ **Good**: "Extracted 42 memories now available in future sessions"
❌ **Bad**: "Done" (no indication of what was accomplished)

## Integration Points

This command integrates with:

1. **Transcript Tracking** (`amplifier/memory/transcript_tracker.py`)
   - Identifies unprocessed transcripts
   - Marks transcripts processed after extraction

2. **Watchdog Manager** (`amplifier/memory/watchdog.py`)
   - Spawns and monitors worker subprocess
   - Handles progress streaming and UI rendering

3. **Extraction Worker** (`amplifier/memory/extraction_worker.py`)
   - Does actual extraction work in subprocess
   - Reports progress via JSON-lines protocol

4. **State Tracker** (`amplifier/memory/state_tracker.py`)
   - Tracks extraction progress for crash recovery
   - Enables `/cleanup` command to resume

## Related Commands

- **`/cleanup`**: Inspect/resume crashed or interrupted extractions
- **`/transcripts`**: Manage and restore conversation transcripts

- **Crash Recovery**: `docs/CRASH_RECOVERY.md` - State tracking system
- **Memory System**: `docs/MEMORY_SYSTEM.md` - Overall architecture

## Remember

This command embodies **user control**. The user decides:
- Whether to extract (not forced)
- When to stop (Ctrl+C anytime)
- Whether to resume (via `/cleanup` later)

The command's job is to:
1. Make the choice clear
2. Show progress transparently
3. Handle errors gracefully
4. Preserve work if interrupted

**Trust the subprocess architecture**. Don't try to manage extraction directly - just spawn the watchdog and let it handle the complexity.
